    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <p>Carpet Warehouse Outlet</p>
    <p>2001 to 2021</p>
    <p>I worked for a flooring store and over the course of that job I had many hats.
      The most important part of that job was taking care of customers and making them
      happy, without customers there is no business so that was priority.
      I also built and took care of all the computers and the network
      which I will always maintain for this company. I also entered data in
      QuickBooks that included the bills and customer invoices. I was also responsible
      for inventory control and maintenance. This was a big job that included tagging
      all inventory and adding it to the computer as well as keeping track of it. There
      was no task at Carpet Warehouse that I did not do except to physically install flooring.
      All other aspects of the sales and accounting I partook in over the two decades that.
      I worked there. </p>
